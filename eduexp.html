                    <p>Following graduation from Engineering school the 'Pandemic' surfaced and shallowed out employment opportunities for entry level environmental engineers. This lead to my enrollment in KU's Data Analytics Bootcamp. The tech world and realm of coding always fascinated me therefore I calculated this coding-based bootcamp to be my best opportunity to diversify my portfolio.</p>

                    <p>I began my college career at The University of Kansas. At first, I did had no idea what I was getting myself into. The University's large size and lack of interaction with superior's led to an uncharacteristic academic performance.
                        Through trials, tribulations, and determination I was able to overcome all barriers to obtain a BS in Civil Engineering with a concentration in Environmental Engineering.</p>

                    <p>Following the completion of high school I immedietly joined the ranks of the Air National Guard of Kansas. I contributed as a member of Civil Engineering squadron in the Structural Engineering division. This
                        assignment was the main decision-making factor in regards to my choice of major.</p>

                    <p>I did not have your typical high school experience. My 9-12 career consisted of 6 high-schools, multiple sports teams during the same season, and an ongoing struggle to establish roots or a peer-level support system. I was fortunate enough to spend the entirety of my last two years of high school at Ottawa high school. Here I was able to excel in academics recieving the 'Kansas Honors Scholors' award and obtain an overall GPA of approximately 3.9.</p>
