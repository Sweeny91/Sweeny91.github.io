                <p>Following graduation from The School of Engineering the 'Pandemic' surfaced and shallowed out employment opportunities for entry level civil engineers, especially positions pertaining to the environmental sector.</p>
                <p>This lead to my enrollment in KU's Data Analytics Bootcamp. The tech world and realm of coding always fascinated me. I thought that this coding-based data analytics program would be my best opportunity to 'get my foot in the door' when
                    it came to the the tech world as well as diversify my portfolio.</p>

                <p>I began my 'offical' college career at The University of Kansas. At first, I did had no idea what I was getting myself into. The University's large size and lack of interaction with superior's led to an uncharacteristic academic performance.
                    Through trials, tribulations, and determination I was able to overcome all barriers to obtain a BS in Civil Engineering with a concentration in Environmental Engineering.</p>

                <p>Following the completion of high school I immedietly joined the ranks of the Air National Guard of Kansas. I contributed as a member of Civil Engineering squadron in the Structural Engineering division know as the "Structure's Shop". This
                    assignment was the main decision-making factor in regards to my choice of major. This was primarily due to the fact that one was required to obtain a civil engineering degree in order to become a 'Civil Engineering' officer.</p>

                <p>I did not have your typical high school experience. My 9-12 career consisted of 6 high-schools, multiple sports teams during the same season, and an ongoing struggle to establish roots or a peer-level support system.</p>
                <p> I was fortunate enough to spend the entirety of my last two years of high school at Ottawa high school. Here I was able to excel in academics recieving the 'Kansas Honors Scholors' award and obtain an overall GPA of approximately 3.9.</p>
                <p> In addition to academics I also participated in extracurriculars such as cross country, wresting, and spanish club. During my senior year I help positions as Captain of the Cross Country and Wrestling teams as well as the Vice-President
                    of Spanish Club.</p>
