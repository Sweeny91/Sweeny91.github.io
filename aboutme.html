                    <p>I contributed as an asset to multiple employers throughout my time at KU and gained many technical and social skills which contribute to my diversibility and strong professional presence in the work setting.</p>
                    <!-- More about me-->
                    <p>I am now pursuing an AAS of Computer Information Systems from 'Johnson County Community College' as well as a second Bachelors in Mathematics from 'The University of Missouri - Kansas City' </p>
                    <P> My current goals are to gain a deeper understanding of mathematics, programmings languages, machine learning, and the blockchain in order to become an asset in the ever-growing STEM field!</P>

                    <h2> Brief Background </h2>
                    <p> I was born in Clinton, MO on November 10th, 1991. Due to socioeconomic impacts my small family moved around along and often times lives with various family memebers. Between Kindergarten and graduation I attended nearly 30 different schools, including 6 different high schools. Luckily my last few years were spent entirely at Ottawa High School of Ottawa, KS. Here I was able to establish some roots and an identity. I played sports such as cross country amd wrestling and graduted with a 3.9 gpa, all while holding a full time job. </p> 
                    <p> Following graduation I signed with the Air National Gaurd of Kansas and served for 4 years while attending the University of Kansas - Engineering School  </p>
                    <p> I lived in Lawrence, KS from 2011-2019. During this time I held multiple jobs while struggling through the Engineering curriculum. I fought through the ups and downs of college and in May 2019 became the first person in my family to graduate college. </p>
                    <p> I now reside in downtown Kansas City, MO. I am a super-full time student pursuing an ASS in CIS from JCCC as well as a second BS in Mathematics from UMKC. Outside of my education I work a part time position at a historical downtown distillery while trying make time for my family, hobbies, and ambitions. </p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p> My hobbies are not just hobbies. They have came to define me and have played a fundamental role on who I am. I have been skateboarding and playing competitve billiards since I was a pre-teen. They have taken me to amazing places and introduced me to some pretty fascinating people. </p> 
                    <p> When I fall in love with something, I fall hard. And thats exactly what happened when I was introduced to skateboarding and pool. Having these two individual sports to practice and compete in allowed me to express my creativity and skills in a unique way. Both are astistic and involve physics, which I believe tob be reasons I love them so much. </p>
